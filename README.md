# CG Project: Igreja de Fernão Velho

This is a project of a 3D modeling church at Fernão Velho, Maceió, Brazil. It was requested for a Computer Graphics Class at IC (Computing Institute) at Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL).

Teacher: Marcelo Costa Oliveira
Students: Vanessa Soares Vieira and Eduarda Tatiane Chagas

For this project we used:
  - OpenGL with C++ 
  - SFML
  - SOIL
  - Makefile
  - QtCreator IDE (only in the first part of the project)

# How to run on Linux
First of all, I need to say that it's kinda hard to use the SFML library mencioned before on MacOSX. QtCreator helped to run only with OpenGL in the first part of the project (when we didn't need to use textures). I believed it is possible but I think I spent more time trying to run on my macbook than developing the code. Luckily on Linux is waaay easier.

  - First of all: install everything with command line. Just google how to install OpenGl, SFML and SOIL.
  - Go to the project's directory on command line.
  - Run the command: make (it will compile everything)
  - Run the command: ./main

And that's it! Good luck :)
